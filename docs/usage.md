# User Guide {: .doctitle}
Configuration and usage of ThemeScheduler.

---

## General Use
Set your rules in `User/ThemeScheduler.sublime-settings` (it will automatically be created).  Then set `#!js "enabled": True`.

### Optional Dependencies
- Applying filters requires [ThemeTweaker plugin](https://github.com/facelessuser/ThemeTweaker).
- Alternative notifications require the [SubNotify plugin](https://github.com/facelessuser/SubNotify).

## Examples
### Changing Themes

```js
    "themes":
    [
        {
            "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/sometheme.tmTheme",
            "time": "21:30"
        },
        {
            "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/someothertheme.tmTheme",
            "time": "8:30"
        }
    ]
```

For themes installed via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/), you can specify their paths as if they are installed in `Packages` folder. (Package Control will usually install the packages as zip files with `.sublime-package` extension in `Installed Packages` instead to the `Packages` folder, but you treat them as if they are stored in the `Packages` folder unzipped. Sublime handles the abstraction. For example,

```js
    "themes":
    [
        {
            "theme": "Packages/One Dark Color Scheme/One Dark.tmTheme",
            "time": "21:30"
        },
        {
            "theme": "Packages/Github Color Theme/GitHub.tmTheme",
            "time": "8:30"
        }
    ]
```

### Using filters
See ThemeTweaker's [custom filter documentationn](http://facelessuser.github.io/ThemeTweaker/usage/#custom-filter) for more info on configuring filter options.  The `filters` argument is constructed the same way.

```js
    "themes":
    [
        {
            "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.tmTheme",
            "filters": "brightness(.98)@bg",
            "time": "10:00"
        },
        {
            "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.tmTheme",
            "filters": "brightness(.97)@bg;glow(.1)",
            "time": "11:00"
        }
    ]
```

### Displaying Messages at Theme Change
Messages will be done through the Sublime API via a popup dialog or status bar.  If you are using the [SubNotify plugin](https://github.com/facelessuser/SubNotify) with the `use_sub_notify` option enabled in the settings file, messages will be displayed through SubNotify.

```js
    "themes":
    [
        {
            // Lunch
            "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.tmTheme",
            "filters": "brightness(.96)@bg;glow(.1)",
            "time": "12:00",
            "msg": "Lunch time!"
        }
    ]
```

### Setting the UI Theme
When changing a theme, Sublime may look funny because it does not refresh all of the UI.  You can try resizing the window, moving the element (like a tab) or restart Sublime.  ThemeScheduler has no control over this, so if the results are unsatisfactory, or you find yourself restarting Sublime to clear the glitches, then this feature may not be one that you want to use.  If in the future, Sublime handles theme refresh better on theme changes, this feature may become even more useful.

```js
{
    // Lunch
    "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.tmTheme",
    "filters": "brightness(.96)@bg;glow(.1)",
    "time": "12:00",
    "msg": "Lunch time!",
    "ui_theme": "Aprosopo Dark@st3.sublime-theme",
    "time": "21:00"
},
```

### Run a Sublime ApplicationCommand
ThemeScheduler allows setting a specific command with arguments.  ThemeScheduler currently, only allows `Application` commands to be run on change.  You can work around this by simply writing an application command that wraps around view or windows commands if you absolutely have to run them.

```js
{
    // Lunch
    "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.tmTheme",
    "filters": "brightness(.96)@bg;glow(.1)",
    "time": "12:00",
    "msg": "Lunch time!",
    "command": {
        "command": "set_aprosopo_theme", "args":
        {
            "theme": "light",
            "color": "blue"
        }
    },
    "time": "21:00"
},
```

## Settings
Theme Scheduler has only a small handful of settings outside the theme change rules.

### enabled
This is a boolean that controls whether ThemeScheduler is active.

```js
"enabled": true
```

### use_sub_notify
To use [SubNotify plugin](https://github.com/facelessuser/SubNotify) for notification messages, just enable SubNotify usage with this setting (assuming SubNotify has been installed).

```js
"use_sub_notify": true,
```

### themes
This is an array of all your ThemeScheduler rules.

```js

"themes": [
    {
        // Lunch
        "theme": "Packages/User/Color Scheme/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.tmTheme",
        "filters": "brightness(.96)@bg;glow(.1)",
        "time": "12:00",
        "msg": "Lunch time!",
        "ui_theme": "Aprosopo Dark@st3.sublime-theme",
        "time": "21:00"
    }
]
```
